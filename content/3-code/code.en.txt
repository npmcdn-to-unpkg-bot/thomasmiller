Languages: 

###HTML / CSS
These are the languages that build up most of the layout of a webpage. As a frontender, I use them day in and day out. Html markup for the structure of pages, and css to make it nice and shiny.

###Javascript
This is the language that runs in the browser, that creates interactions. I have been using Javascript, alongside with libraries such as jQuery for a while. I am currently learning some new js frameworks, I am slowly digging my way through Vue.js and React.

###PHP
This my backend language of choice. I use it mostly for templating in php-based content management systems such as WordPress or Kirby, among other stuff.

Cms: 

Content Management Systems are frameworks that do exactly what there name says: they help you to manage your content. There are lots of different CMSs out there, the most common one is WordPress.

###WordPress
WordPress is a great tool, I have used it in some projects. If setup correctly, it allows for clients to really take care of publishing their own content, and there are a lot of plugins that allow to get jobs done quickly. However though WP powers a huge amount of websites, it has some downsides that are making me try to avoid it lately: it is often slower than other CMSs, it is overkill for some projects, and most of all it requires a lot of updates/security measures due to the amount of vulnerabilities it has.

###Kirby
This is my CMS of choice. (link: https://getkirby.com/ text: Kirby) is a file-based CMS that is super flexible. Kirby works without having a database, all the content is stored in files using the markup syntax. This means incredibly fast websites! I use it in most of my recent projects, I love it.

###Joomla
For better of for worse, I also have some decent knowledge of Joomla-powered websites due to updating old websites at the office. I don't recommend using Joomla in any new projects, it is a huge pain in my opinion. It is a CMS, however I feel like managing content with Joomla is a constant pain.

Workflow: 

These are my regular tools that I use every day, that make my coding way more enjoyable and efficient.

###Git
Version control is necessary for coding in general, not only for websites. The most common used version control system is Git, which I use day in day out.

###jQuery
jQuery is a javascript library that I have used quite a lot while coding javascript. It gets things done quickly and with a nice API.

###Gulp
Gulp is a build system that I use to get my tasks done automatically. Gulp, together with different node modules, can help to minify and concatenate css/javascript. An awesome package I use with it is Browsersync, which reloads/refreshes different browsers/devices whenever I save a file locally.

###Sass
Sass is the css preprocessor that I use all the time.

###Bootstrap and Susy
I have used Bootstrap to add responsiveness to my websites quickly. However, since I only use the grid system of Bootstrap, I have been looking into the Susy grid lately.

Tools: 

###Sketch
Sketch is design program for Mac. I use it to create prototypes, to export ressources such as svg/png, and to create different layouts for different screen sizes while planning a project.

###Photoshop
I have good knowledge of this awesome image editing software. I use it a lot for editing personal pictures I took with my Sony A6000, as well as just editing random stuff I found on the internet.

###OSX
As a frontend dev, I work essentially on Mac of course. iMac at the office, Macbook Pro at home. I have also always been a gamer, so I couldn't live without having a Windows PC too.

----

Ecommerce: 

###Woocommerce
I have done a couple Ecommerce websites using WP with the Woocommerce plugin. The biggest Ecommerce project I built is (link: http://whiskytrain.ch text:  Whisky Train), which sold hundreds of tickets in a couple hours.

Future: 

###My future interests
The internet never stops evolving and new technologies keep appearing every year. Just a few years ago, responsive web design wasn't even a thing. Therefore, web developers always need to stay up-to-date with new technologies or frameworks. I still am very eager to learn new things and keep growing my skills.

Right now, I have set a couple new objectives: learn more about animations and interactions on the web. I want to learn to use the Greensock framework and Snapsvg for more complex svg animations. I also want to keep growing as a javascript developer, using the new ES6, Nodejs, and I want to master a framework such as Vue, React or Angular.
