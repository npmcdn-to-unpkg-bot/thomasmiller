Text: This was a small project I made a long time ago. I was starting to get into photoshop so I drew the view of the mountains from my house. Afterwards, I decided to have a try at parallaxing the whole thing. And yes, I totally stole the idea from <a href=" http://www.firewatchgame.com/" target="_blank">this website</a>.
